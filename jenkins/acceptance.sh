#   edx-acceptance.sh
#
#   Execute acceptance tests for edx-platform.
#
#   This script can be called from a Jenkins
#   job that defines these environment variables:
#
#   `TEST_SUITE` defines which acceptance test suite to run
#   Possible values are:
#
#       - "lms": Run the acceptance (Selenium) tests for the LMS
#       - "cms": Run the acceptance (Selenium) tests for Studio
#
#   `FEATURE_PATH` is the path to the lettuce .feature file
#       containing the tests to run.  If empty, run all the tests.
#
#   Other assumptions:
#
#   - The edx-platform git repository is checked out by the Jenkins git plugin.
#
#   - Jenkins logs in as user "jenkins"
#
#   - The Jenkins file system root is "/home/jenkins"
#
#   - An init script creates a virtualenv at "/home/jenkins/edx-venv"
#     with some requirements pre-installed (such as scipy)
#
#  Jenkins worker setup:
#  See the edx/configuration repo for Jenkins worker provisioning scripts.
#  The provisioning scripts install requirements that this script depends on!
